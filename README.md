this is my project 3 code, it is played using just number inputs. You continue to explore facing different generated monster that you bsttle and level up. The higher the level the wider you enemy pool is and the stronger the enemy. Certain custom exceptions were raised for many different scenarios, for example they raise for insufficient gold, if something doesnt load correctly, if you inventory is full, if the action doesnt match the appropiate item, just to name a few. The organization of the files is default but it made sense to me that way when I started coding, it starts with initializing parts that I would end up using later on in different files, such as character manager is first but the things initialized in character manager connected when I started to work on main. Also with exceptions I tried to raise them when even the player tries to do something outside of the scope of the game. I did make any major changes to the default rules, but I would have liked to implemnt different variants of the mobs that the player would face in the exploration. The Ai used was chat gpt, it was usued periodicxally throught the code mainly just for logic error fixes or to double check certain function for any glaring errors that were missed by the ide, besides that chat gpt was not used to write any code, beside help writing for save/load character. Chat gpt was use pretty agressivly when try to fix my files issue. Even though I wasnt getting any errors on my ide the test cases where not passing because of the files not being correctly pathwayed. Even using AI did not help a lot because it was having a hard time unbderstnad the file pathway that was neededs. I used AI toi rewite my save.load characters but I was still getting errors until I figured out the my SAVE_DIR was initiallised with the wrong dir.

# COMP 163: Project 3 - Quest Chronicles

**AI Usage: Free Use (with explanation requirement)**

## Overview

Build a complete modular RPG adventure game demonstrating mastery of **exceptions and modules**.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Accept Assignment
1. Click the assignment link provided in Blackboard
2. Accept the assignment - this creates your personal repository
3. Clone your repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone [your-personal-repo-url]
cd [repository-name]
```

### Step 2: Understand the Project Structure

Your repository contains:

```

│   └── test_game_integration.py       # Integration tests
└── README.md                   # This file
```

### Step 3: Development Workflow

```bash
# Work on one module at a time
# Test your code frequently

# Commit and push to see test results
git add .
git commit -m "Implement character_manager module"
git push origin main

# Check GitHub for test results (green checkmarks = passed!, red xs = at least 1 failed test case. Click the checkmark or x and then "Details" to see what test cases passed/failed)
```

## Core Requirements (60 Points)

### Critical Constraint
You may **only** use concepts covered through the **Exceptions and Modules** chapters. 

### 🎨 Creativity and Customization

This project encourages creativity! Here's what you can customize:

**✅ FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE:**
- **Character stats** - Adjust health, strength, magic for balance
- **Enemy stats** - Make enemies easier or harder
- **Special abilities** - Design unique abilities for each class
- **Additional enemies** - Add your own enemy types beyond the required three
- **Game mechanics** - Add status effects, combos, critical hits, etc.
- **Quest rewards** - Adjust XP and gold amounts
- **Item effects** - Create unique items with creative effects

**⚠️ REQUIRED (for testing):**
- **4 Character classes:** Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Cleric (names must match exactly)
- **3 Enemy types:** "goblin", "orc", "dragon" (must exist, stats flexible)
- **All module functions** - Must have the specified function signatures
- **Exception handling** - Must raise appropriate exceptions

**💡 CREATIVITY TIPS:**
1. Start with required features working
2. Add creative elements incrementally
3. Test after each addition
4. Be ready to explain your design choices in the interview
5. Bonus interview points for thoughtful, balanced customization!

**Example Creative Additions:**
- Vampire enemy that heals when attacking
- Warrior "Last Stand" ability that activates when health is low
- Poison status effect that deals damage over time
- Critical hit system based on character stats
- Rare "legendary" weapons with special effects

### Module 1: custom_exceptions.py (PROVIDED - 0 points to implement)

**This module is provided complete.** It defines all custom exceptions you'll use throughout the project.

### Module 2: game_data.py (10 points)

### Module 3: character_manager.py (15 points)

### Module 4: inventory_system.py (10 points)

### Module 5: quest_handler.py (10 points)

### Module 6: combat_system.py (10 points)

### Module 7: main.py (5 points)

## Automated Testing & Validation (60 Points)

## Interview Component (40 Points)

**Creativity Bonus** (up to 5 extra points on interview):
- Added 2+ custom enemy types beyond required three
- Designed unique and balanced special abilities
- Implemented creative game mechanics (status effects, advanced combat, etc.)
- Thoughtful stat balancing with clear reasoning

**Note:** Creativity is encouraged, but functionality comes first! A working game with required features scores higher than a broken game with lots of extras.

### Update README.md

Document your project with:

1. **Module Architecture:** Explain your module organization
2. **Exception Strategy:** Describe when/why you raise specific exceptions
3. **Design Choices:** Justify major decisions
4. **AI Usage:** Detail what AI assistance you used
5. **How to Play:** Instructions for running the game

### What to Submit:

1. **GitHub Repository:** Your completed multi-module project
2. **Interview:** Complete 10-minute explanation session
3. **README:** Updated documentation

## Protected Files Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Test Integrity**

Test files are provided for your learning but are protected. Modifying test files constitutes academic dishonesty and will result in:

- Automatic zero on the project
- Academic integrity investigation

You can view tests to understand requirements, but any modifications will be automatically detected.
